# Big O Notation

**Summary:**
- Big O Notation is a mathematical concept used to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms.
- It describes the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate as the input size approaches infinity.
- Provides a standardized way to express time and space complexity without focusing on specific implementation details.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **O(1):**
   - Constant time complexity.
   - Examples include accessing an element in an array by index.

2. **O(log n):**
   - Logarithmic time complexity.
   - Example: Binary search.

3. **O(n):**
   - Linear time complexity.
   - Example: Iterating through an array.

4. **O(n log n):**
   - Log-linear time complexity.
   - Common in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
