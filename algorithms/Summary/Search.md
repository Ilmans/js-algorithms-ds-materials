# Searching Algorithms

**Summary:**
- Searching is the process of finding a specific item in a collection of items.
- Various searching algorithms exist, each with different characteristics and use cases.

**Common Searching Algorithms:**
1. **Linear Search:**
   - Iterates through each element in a collection until the target element is found or the end of the collection is reached.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Applicable to sorted collections; divides the search space in half until the target element is found or the search space becomes empty.


**Efficiency and Use Cases:**
- The efficiency of a searching algorithm depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, whether the data is sorted, and the distribution of values.

**Considerations:**
- Linear search is simple but may not be efficient for large datasets.
- Binary search is highly efficient but requires a sorted dataset.
