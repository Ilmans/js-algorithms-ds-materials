# Sorting Algorithms

**Summary:**
- Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science to arrange elements in a specific order.
- Different sorting algorithms exist, each with unique characteristics.

**Common Sorting Algorithms:**
1. **Bubble Sort:**
   - Simple and inefficient; suitable for small datasets.

2. **Insertion Sort:**
   - Builds the final sorted array incrementally; suitable for small datasets.

3. **Selection Sort:**
   - Divides the input into sorted and unsorted regions; not efficient for large datasets.

4. **Merge Sort:**
   - Divides and conquers, suitable for large datasets; stable and predictable performance.

5. **Quick Sort:**
   - Divides and conquers with a pivot; efficient for large datasets; widely used in practice.

**Selection Criteria:**
- Choose sorting algorithm based on dataset size, stability requirements, and data characteristics.
